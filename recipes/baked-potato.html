        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Extremely simple dish to make. All you need is a russet potato, access to an oven, and whatever topping you may desire!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Russet Potato</li>
            <li>Toppings: I recommend butter, sour cream, and chives.</li>
            <li>Seasoning: salt and pepper. Rosemary can also be a nice touch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li>
            <li>Rinse off potato and use a fork to poke holes along its spine. This prevents potato explosion.</li>
            <li>Place potato on oven rack and cook for 45 min to 1 hour, until potato has softened.</li>
            <li>Remove potato from oven and cut lengthwise, aka, potato spine. Add desired toppings, including seasoning, and viola, potato is ready for consumption!</li>
        </ol>
